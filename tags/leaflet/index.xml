Below map is embedded in this post with the help of shortcode created by Simonfrey which uses OSM and Leaflet. A popup is added like a cherry on the top of a cake. Placing layout/shortcode in /themes folder was an issue in the beginning. Later this folder is moved into the root folder of this blog. This change practically resolved the issue with adaptability of leaflet shortcode.</description></item></channel></rss>
